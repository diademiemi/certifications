# SUSE Rancher
Rancher is a software stack for Kubernetes. Rancher provides many tools such as RKE (Rancher Kubernetes Engine), K3S, Rancher Manager, Longhorn, Fleet and more.  s

Everything in Rancher is managed by Rancher Manager. Rancher Manager is a web-based UI that allows you to manage Kubernetes clusters, namespaces, projects, users, etc. All of these products are open source and free to use.  

To practice for exams relating to Rancher (sca-rancher-2-6, scds_rancher_mgt_2_7, scds-ran-k8s), I have built a homelab around Rancher. You can find this project here:
[https://github.com/diademiemi/homelab](https://github.com/diademiemi/homelab)  

This homelab makes use of K3S, Rancher Manager (With Terraform), Fleet and Longhorn and more tools outside of Rancher. More information can be found in the README of the homelab project.
